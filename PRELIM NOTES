USING C++, MAKE A FILE NAMED PRELIM.CPP
contains code for executing algorithms (in order): 
round robin
shortest job first
shortest remaining time first
*recommended time quantum

can put different values
make sure that the variables are not used in full term, should be in acronym (turnaround time = tt) use, tt.
make sure variables processed are encapulated in struc named "process"
there should be a calculator for quantum time in round robin, should calculate the median or mean of burst time to calculate quantum time. 
- the calculated quantum should be used
- should be named "recommended time quantum"

display in table the result values
it should look as follows: column for process id, arrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, waiting time. after the table, output the average turn around time, and average waiting time. 
in main, the arrival and burst time should be declared 
- it should be as follows
- arrival time: 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 8, 7
- burst time: 53, 43, 18, 16, 44, 73, 99, 27

it should display the table in order, one table per algorithm (there should be 3): rr, sjf, srtf. 
the main should declare, it should automtically run all
the order of the code should be: reco time quantum, rr, sjf,srtf, main

all should be in three algorithms and should produce the tables
